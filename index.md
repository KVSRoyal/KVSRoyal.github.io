# About

I'm a Computer Science major with an emphasis in Entertainment Arts and Engineering at the University of Utah. I grew up in rural Jamaica, and moved to Utah for college. I am passionate about Computing Education Research, Data Science, and their overlap!

I am currently writing a book with my mom, Janette Kaloo, about her experience with Stage III Breast Cancer. We hope to have it done by the end of the year!

Let's go Janette!
